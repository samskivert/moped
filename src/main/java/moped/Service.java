     * loading process so that it can populate a config root before any modes are resolved on the
     * buffer, enabling per-project configuration. The project service does nothing at resolution
     * time other than to register a hook to be called when a new workspace is created, and that
     * hook registers a per-workspace hook which does project resolution when a buffer is
     * created.</p>
