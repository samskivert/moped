/** Enables the dispatch of events to loosely coupled listeners. An event is simply a POJO
  * (conventionally named `FooEvent`). Listeners are registered on the type of the event class
  * (mechanisms exist to register on a supertype and listen on a subtype).
  *
  * Different event busses exist at different "scopes" (for example, global, workspace-wide,
  * editor-wide). An event should naturally lend itself to a particular scope. For example, an
  * event indicating that a buffer was opened in an editor would naturally be dispatched on the
  * editor's event bus.
