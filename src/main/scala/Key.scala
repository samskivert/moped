  /** Defines a key binding. Trigger sequences are defined thusly: A single key consists of the key
    * identifier (e.g. 'g', 'F1', '-',) prefixed by zero or more modifier keys ('C-' for control,
    * 'M-' for meta, 'A-' for alt, and 'S-' for shift). Key sequences consist of single keys
    * separated by spaces. Examples:
    *
    *  - `e`: lowercase e
    *  - `S-s`: upper case S
    *  - `C-c`: control-c
    *  - `C-c C-i`: control-c followed by control-i
    *
    * The fn bindings are defined by the mode, by using the [[Fn]] annotation on methods. The name
    * in the keymap corresponds to the de-camel-cased method name (see [[Mode]] docs). When a mode
    * refers to its own fns, it may provide just the name, but if a mode (or a mode hook) refers to
    * another mode's fns, it must prefix the name by the name of the mode and a colon (e.g.
    * "scala:goto-term").
