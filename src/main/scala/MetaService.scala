    * a single public constructor.
    *
    * The arguments to that constructor are matched from `args` such that when a constructor
    * argument `a1` is seen, the first object in `args` which has compatible type is used. That
    * object is then removed from `args` and the process continues for constructor argument `a2`
    * and so forth. Additionally, if constructur argument is seen that is of some subtype of
    * `AbstractService`, then the appropriate service is resolved and used.
    *
    * It is not necessary for `args` to be completely consumed during this process. A service may
    * inject dependencies into its plugins when resolving them and may provide a variety of
    * optional arguments that the plugin may opt not to consume. Note, however, that due to the
    * fact that arguments are matched in order and by type, a plugin MUST consume the first argument
    * of a given type before it can consume subsequent arguments of that type. Services may wish
    * to take this restriction into account and provide unique types for injectable arguments
    * that might merely box a string or integer.
