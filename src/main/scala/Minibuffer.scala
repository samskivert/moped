  /** Invokes the minibuffer with mode `mode`, supplying `result` and `args` as arguments to the

    * follow that naming convention. Thus `"read"` will resolve a mode named `"mini-read"`.

    * mode will communicate its results. That promise is returned (as a `Future`) via which the
    * caller can receive a result from the minibuffer mode. For example:
    *
    * {{{
    * editor.mini("read", Promise[String](), "Find file: ", ...) onSuccess { path => ... }
